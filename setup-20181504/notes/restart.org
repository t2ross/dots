* "Bullshit!" Analysis of alt/rad-movements
** Central questions
keywords: behavioral analysis; signal theory; linguistics; political movements; social movements
- Questions:
  - What are the common traits shared between current alt/rad-movements?
  - Can we create a nuanced, generalizable model to describe formation of these groups?
  - Can we create a set of models to document processes and sub-processes within these groups?
  - Can we then tie these micro models into a larger macro model?
** What I have so far
*** Really... what are these groups?
  - They exist on the margins of the greater discourse
  - Chief objective: insert their lesser discourse into the greater discourse
  - Analogy: Stone Soup with unknown variables "Is it poison?"
  - Some ideas are poison; without true tests, nearly impossible to tell
*** Greater and lesser discourse
  - What is discourse
    - From Foucault: ... (to add later)
    - How we define the subjective cultural reality: norms, mores, ethics, traditions, worldview
    - Example: View of homosexuality since 1960's to now
  - Greater Discourse
    - How the average population views things
    - "Universal" to how the meta-group sees itself and the world around it
  - Lesser Discourse
    - held by groups that are partially excluded from the Greater Discourse
    - divergent groups that vie to include their ideas in the "Stone Soup"
    - Competition against both the Greater Discourse and the other groups
    - ex: Alt-right/fascists; Rad-left/(numerous leftist ideologies; Stalinism, anarchism, and socialism at forefront)
- Commonalities between both:
  - potential for splitting, creation of factions within either discourse
  - factionalism creates competition for control of the discourse
  - also occurs when a Lesser Discourse enters the pool of the Greater Discourse
  - realization that both will subsume smaller groups (in numbers and ideology) in order to add a measure of variety
*** Violence and its place in the alt/rad movements
  -(Pull some thought wrt/ Islam view of Jihad)
  - Define the types of violence
    - physical: harm done to persons or property
    - social: ostracization, rumors, smear campaigns, etc. used to lower a person's status
    - cyber: attacks that will remove a person's platform for speech: DDoS, pressure or attacks against the hosting provider
  - Threat of violence used to enforce conformity among members
    - Implicit threat through actions taken against dissenters and outsiders
    - the threats help quiet insiders that would otherwise raise probing questions/express criticism of movement
  - Against outsiders
    - violence against outsiders can be both helpful and harmful
    - helps: protection, backs-up some soft-power, attraction of a certain kind of recruit: protection, outlet for anger/resentment towards opposition
    - harms: can damage public image, soft power can be seen as a short precursor to hard power, alienation of moderate|pacifist supporter
*** Myths within the discourses
- Stories of oppression
  - (mis-)appropriation of these stories acts as a tool to both form the ideology and create propoganda for recruitment
  - generally focused on (various types of) minority groups/causes
  - "savior complex" fuels the movements; ex: Laura Bush 2001 Weekly Address re: Afghan Women
  - next-generation of imperialist/orientalist thought applied on a more micro level?
- "Liberation theology" as a non-religious tool
  - "veneration" of past thinkers/writers/scholars
  - A form of reactionary politics?
    - Dream of completing the work of these thinkers
      - Examples: Marx's workers' utopia; Hitler's Reich; Klan objectives
*** The results of these myths
**** Damaging to current society
  - Censorship of differing viewpoints
    - Kills opportunity for organic change
    - Squelching progress and creates stagnation and repression
      - Stagnation and repression will create restive and reactive groups
  - Behavior that does not contribute to civil society
      - /"Degeneracy"/ and risks towards protected classes
        - Paedophilia and predation of "barely legal" youths
        - Open lechery, and innapropriate public displays 
      - Subjugation of women
        - treatment of them as property
        - correctional rape
      - Racial politicking
        - equality of opportunity != equality of results
        - supremacy|subjugation of race(s) and racial preference
**** Beneficial to current society
    - Adoption of certain reactionary politics
      - national pride != blind patriotism
      - recognition of the family unit as a necessity
      - optimism: ability to make the world a better place
    - A more nuanced feminism
      - recognition that the choice and agency of women belongs to them
      - framework to show that feminism is expressed in cultural contexts
    - Decentralization of key services
      - monopoly-busting to enable competition
      - allows for more innovation, allows for advancements
      - variety of services (http; ssh; file services)
